My silly project Barking Dog in HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript

This tiny app is basically photo slider with 2 photos of my dog. If you click toggle knob first time, toggle knob changes color to green, photo changes to barking dog and barking adio clip is played. When you click toggle for the second time, toggle knob changes color to grey, photo changes to one with dog mouth shut and sniffing adio clip is played, and so on and so forth...

I made these two funny pictures of my dog Lolka (her full name Lolita) in summer 2020 , it  always put smiles on faces of any person I showed them  to. I constantly played with idea to make small app where I can change these 2 photos and "make" my doggy bark. Thoughts are material and tend to realize in real life. So, here it is, the one and the only ... BARKING DOG APP!!!
